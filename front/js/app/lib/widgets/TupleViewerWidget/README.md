Tuple Viewer for Recordings
===========================

Future plans: 

Ability to mark/flag tuples (saved in localStorage)
Move with the arrows by an increment more than 1 (eg pressing shift to move ten at a time)
Ability to directly enter/edit the current tuple offset
Make the data view more interactive (folding nested json objects)
Create a most-recently-used cache for loaded tuple data (so that there is a max number of tuples that can be kept in memory on the front end)
Display more data about the recording (eg. total tuples in the recording, the start time, the operator name, etc)
