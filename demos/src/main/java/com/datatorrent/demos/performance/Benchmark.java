/**
 * Performance Demo Application:
 * <p> 
 * This demo demonstrates the performance of Datatorrent platform. 
 * Performance is measured by the number of events processed per second and latency. 
 * Performance varies depending on container memory, CPU and network I/O. 
 * The demo can be used to check how the performance varies with stream locality.
 *
 * Stream locality decides how the operators are deployed:
 * ThreadLocal - the operators are deployed within the same thread.
 * ContainerLocal -the operators are deployed as separate threads within the process.
 * NodeLocal- the operators are deployed as separate processes on a machine.
 * RackLocal - the operators are deployed on different nodes of the same rack.
 * NoLocality - lets the engine decide how to best deploy the operator.
 *
 * Note:  NodeLocal and RackLocal are preferences that can be specified to Hadoop ResourceManager. 
 * It is not guaranteed that the operators will be deployed as requested. 
 * ResourceManager makes the call depending on resource availability. 
 * 
 * Refer to demos/docs/PerformanceDemo.md for more details.
 * 
 * </p>
