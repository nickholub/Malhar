/**
 * <br>To insert an object in Couch Db, any concrete implementation of {@link AbstractCouchDBOutputOperator}  needs to
 * provide additional information about the tuple that can be saved in the database. This interface outlines the api
 * of the command that will be executed against Couch-db.</br>
 * <br></br>
 * <br>The command would either update or insert a document in the db. If the docId is already present then the existing
 * document will be updated or otherwise it will be created.</br>
 * <br></br>
 * <br>
 *   When a document already exists in the db then couch-db expects the tuple to have a revision greater than the revision
 *   in the database. So we allow tuples to have revision as null and in that case, the prior revision is fetched from
 *   the database and is set on the object using setRevision.
