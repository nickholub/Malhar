## Configuration
 config.js has application configuration.

 Minimum required configuration:

 - Hadoop ResourceManager

 - Haddop History Server

 - WebSocket URL (DataTorrent Gateway address)

## Prerequisites

  The following should be running:

  - [Map Reduce Monitor Java Application](https://github.com/DataTorrent/Malhar/tree/master/demos/src/main/java/com/datatorrent/demos/mrmonitor)

  - DataTorrent Gateway

## Notes

  It may take 10+ seconds to see data on the first load (Map Reduce Java application starts polling Hadoop REST API
and then publishes it through DataTorrent Gateway WebSocket).

## Running Application in Production Mode

 1. Install Node.js.

 2. Install npm dependencies

 ``` bash
    $ npm install
 ```

 3. Install forever tool

 ``` bash
    $ npm install -g forever
 ```

 4. Start Node.js Server (see prod.sh)

 ``` bash
    $ NODE_ENV=production PORT=3000 forever start app.js
 ```

## Running Application in Development Mode
 Install dependencies:

 ``` bash
    $ npm install
 ```

 Install Bower dependencies:

 ``` bash
    $ bower install
 ```

 Start Node.js server:

 ``` bash
    $ node app
 ```

 Application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Building Application

 Application is built with Grunt (it creates dist folder used in production mode).

 ``` bash
    $ npm install -g grunt-cli
    $ grunt
 ```

## Tips

 Running Node.js as a daemon with [forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever)

 ``` bash
    $ npm install forever -g
    $ forever start app.js
    $ forever list
    $ forever stop <uid>
 ```

 Running Node.js on different port

 ``` bash
    $ PORT=3001 node app
 ```
